Exercise 1:

1. do `npm i cors shortid uuid generate-password`

2. add use cors to app.ts, like:

import express from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';

const app = express();
app.use(cors());

3. add three get endpoints to serverless.yml:
/shortid
/uuid
/password

4. add those three routes to app.ts, so when you hit that endpoint you get a new shortid, uuid, or password.

5. leave some console.logs in those functions, so we can look at the logs.

6. Make sure to return a json object

7. Leave the hello world endpoint.

8. Test locally by running `npm run local` and hitting the endpoints http://localhost:3000/shortid, etc.

9. Deploy to AWS by running `npm run deploy:non-prod`

10.test with the other urls to make sure your code was deployed correctly
